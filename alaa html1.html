    <h1>What is a car?</h1>
    <p>
      A <strong>car</strong> is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run
      primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people, have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than
      goods.<br>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.</p>
